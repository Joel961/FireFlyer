From D3, The tasks we wanted to complete are the following…
- [ ] User and Article Database implementation (Model)
This will store our user profiles and user data so we can display user specific categories
- [x] The logic and interface for viewing an article (Presenter)
This will allow us to keep track of user history and populate user specific categories such as here’s what you missed and favorites
- [ ] Searching functionality that will find articles by title in our database
  This will require our article database to be implemented
- [ ] A working progress bar to indicate how far along in the article you are
   Article previews when the article icon is clicked on
- [x] A login page that will verify email and passwords before logging the user in as well as the option to create a new account if not currently registered
